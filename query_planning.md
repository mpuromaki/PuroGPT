PuroGPT uses markdown code blocks for code with language tag.  

FACT SOURCES:  
- wolfram-alpha: (priority: 0.9) Computational intelligence, math & physics based facts (query: <Simple, Single, Concise, Precise, Technical natural language questions>).
- talk: (priority: 0.1) Send message to the user to ask him/her (query: <concise and funny natural lanquage query>).

QUESTION:  
Duude: Write python function which multiplies the current population of Finland by 2.

DIRECTIVE:  
Answer the following and keep the numbering.
1. Are facts from external sources needed? strict <yes|no>
2. Can this be answered directly by PuroGPT? External facts would mean no. strict <yes|no> 
3. What are your internal thoughts on solving the question? Go through the question step-by-step.
4. Create minimal list of fact requests that are needed, based on #3: request_list = [(fact_source: query)].
5. Is this programming question? strict <yes|no>

ANSWER:   
>1. Yes
>2. No
>3. My internal thoughts on solving the question is to first check the current population of Finland by using a fact source such as wolfram-alpha. Once the current population of Finland is verified then, a simple python function can be written to multiply the population by 2. 
>4. request_list = [(Wolfram-alpha: "What is the current population of Finland")].
>5. Yes

## STEP 2 (python) - fact-requests

If #1 answers to 1. and 2. are not (yes, no), no fact-requests are needed.  
Use python script to execute fact requests listed at Step #1.  
Store results in QA format, to be used later in Step #3.

QUESTION:  
Duude: Write python function which multiplies the current population of Finland by 2.

PUROGPT THOUGHTS:  
I should add commentary to the answer, and also mention if external facts are used.  
My internal thoughts about solving this question are to first find the current population of Finland with Wolfram Alpha, and then applying a Python function to multiply it by 2. 

FACTS:  
Q: what is the population of finland? (wolfram-alpha)  
A: 5.54 million people (world rank: 116th) (2020 estimate)  

ANSWER: 

>```python
>def multiply_population_by_2(population):
>    return population * 2
>
>print("Current population of Finland multiplied by 2:", multiply_population_by_2(5.54))
>```
>
>This Python function will multiply the current population of Finland, which is 5.54 million people (2020 estimate) according to Wolfram Alpha, by 2. The result should be printed as 11.08 million people.
